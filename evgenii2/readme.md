# Problem #2

## Task

Find the sum of even-valued numbers in the Fibonacci sequence below 4mln 

## Solution

Using `while` loop from 0 to 4mln (`max`) take (calculate) each Fibonacci number `c` below `max` and check if it is even-valued (if division by 2 gives 0 reminder).

## Handle change with ease

In order to handle change well the following things were introduced:

`max` - change max (for instance can find sum of even-valued fibonacci members below 10mln)

## Result
