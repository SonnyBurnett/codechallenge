That's an easy one. To get the smallest number that can be divided by the numbers 1 to 10, we need to gather enough
primes, such that we can build all the numbers 1 to 10 out of them. Hence we need 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 5, 7. Multiplying all
those yields 2520, the result from the example.

To get the smalles number dividable we need to add enough primes to that set to also be able to make the umbers 11 to 
20. To do that we need to add the primes > 10 <= 20, which are 11, 13, 17 and 19. The number 12, 14, 15, 19 and 20
can be made already so we only need to add one more 2, to be able to make 16.

Thus we hve the primes 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19. Multiplying all those yields 232792560â€¬.
