# Euler

My solutions to project Euler problems using Python3.8.

## Solutions

Code per problem can be found in the solutions folder. It can be run like so: ```python 1.py```
Potential common helper functions are in util.py.

I also wrote a small wrapper to run each problem and track the duration for you.
Usage: ```./euler.py 1```

## Tests

Tests can be run from the tests folder. like so: ```python test54.py```
If a test fails it will throw an assertion error.

I opted not to use a framework like pytest, so you can use python without the need to pip install anything.

_Incase you did notice the requirements.txt: this is purely for installing pylama linting, not for anything functional._
