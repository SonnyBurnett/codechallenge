    The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers.
    So the 7th triangle number is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms are:
    1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

1.  Factorize into primes
2.  Count how many times the primes (not counting 1 to the set of primes) occur, e.g. 28 = 2^2 * 7^1.
    Now, every divisor is any combination of none to all of those primes. That gives a possible number of combinations
    equal to the product of the times the different primes occur plus 1.
    In the case of 28, this is (2 + 1) * (1 + 1) = 6.
    In the case of 21 (3 * 7): (1 + 1) * (1 + 1) = 4.
    In the case of 3 (3): (1 + 1) = 2.
