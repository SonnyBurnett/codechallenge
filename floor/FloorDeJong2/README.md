# Poker hands

In this repository you can find two solutions to the euler project assignment 54. 

The solution shows the solution of Challenge 54. Which uses one class, namely "PokerHand", 
to determine how many time player one has won.

The solution in the directory "Game" is more elaborate. It is a competition, consisting of 
a list of players that have hands. New players can be added and cards can be dealed. The player that wins the 
latest game can be determined.
