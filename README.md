    This function was made to run on different ranges within the Fibonacci sequence.
    The first parameter determines where the range of the Fibonacci sequence should start.
    If the first parameter is a Fibonacci number, the range will start with that number. 
    If the first parameter is not a Fibonacci number, the range will start with first Fibonacci number that comes after this parameter.
    The second parameter is the maximum value for the range. The last Fibonacci number used in the function should be below this value.
    The result is a sum of all even Fibonacci numbers in the specified range.
