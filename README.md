# Euler

My solutions to project Euler problems using Python3.8.

## Solutions

Code per problem can be found in the solutions folder.
Potential common helper functions are in util.py.

I also wrote a small wrapper to run each problem and track the duration for you.
Usage: ```./euler.py 1```

**PLEASE NOTE: I now use python3.8 functionality**
